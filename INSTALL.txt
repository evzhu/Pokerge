Build Instructions:

Playing the game:
  - Be warned, there is an assumption that the user understands the game in freeplay
  - To start, enter Y or N to decide if you'd like to play
  - You will be loaded into a game against an Ai bot. From here you can see your hand and the pot. 
  - Enter one of the following commands: call, check, bet, fold, quit
    - If you enter bet you will be prompted to enter an amount to bet
  - Repeat this process depending on what the bot does
